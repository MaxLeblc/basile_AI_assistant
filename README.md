# basile_AI_assistant

Here's a test to create an AI personal assistant in Python called Basile.

OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo for the AI and ElevenLabs for the voice synthesizer.

The program works, but the response time needs to be optimized.

I'm also looking for a less onerous custom voice synthesizer solution.

Finally, this is my first project in Python and I need to learn more about it.
